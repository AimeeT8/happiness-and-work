# happiness-and-work
I created a bubble plot to compare happiness and annual salary. I used Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I used hue, size, and sizes arguments to 
create multi-sized bubbles. It shows the relation between the Annual Salary of Full-time workers and the Happiness score of 
citizens(not just full-time workers).
